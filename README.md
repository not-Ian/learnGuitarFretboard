# Learn your guitar fretboard

Inspired by the MusicTheoryForGuitar YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJddQ6Q0UDo

Set up the notes you want to play, how quickly you want to play, and whether you want to go up and down the neck, or just up/down.

Note: not tested on Mac/Linux. I think Mac will _need_ to run on the terminal and not an IDE for the metronome to work.
